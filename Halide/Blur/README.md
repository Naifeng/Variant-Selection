Within each file:

1. generate the dataset using the code in *experiments*. Instuctions for compling and running are included in the top of .cpp files.
2. put the generated .csv file in *prediction*.
3. run the performance prediction model with 
```
python pred_*.py
```
`pred_NN.py` uses common neural networks.
`pred_NN+C.py` uses augmented neural networks.

4. In *results*, `plot.ipynb` can be used to plot the speedup. Contents in .csv have to be manually inspected now.
